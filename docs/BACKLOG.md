# Backlog and decision log

This is the durable runbook for review findings, architecture candidates and
product ideas. Nothing is silently discarded: every finding is either **fixed**,
**filed as a GitHub issue**, or **recorded as a decision** here with the reason.

## Workflow

1. A review, architecture pass or planning session produces a finding.
2. The coordinator gives it an ID (`B-001`), an area and a priority.
3. Choose one:
   - **Fix now** — small enough for the current slice.
   - **Issue** — draft it, pass the IR review, then file it on GitHub with the
     `area:*` and `priority:*` labels and link it here. A spec is written
     before implementation.
   - **Decision** — reject or defer with a concrete reason and a trigger for
     revisiting. This is the only allowed way to not act.
4. Issues move through the normal workflow: IR review → OpenSpec change and
   PIR/DXR spec review → TDD-Red → implementer → review swarm → archive.
5. Re-check this list at every release and after every review swarm.

## How agents work

- This file is intake. A GitHub issue is for durable, actionable, testable
  work; the decision tree is in
  [`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`](agents/issue-tracker.md).
- One issue per OpenSpec change; keep each issue to one coherent change. Batch
  related chores under one meta issue instead of opening an issue per note.
- `ready-for-agent` means testable acceptance criteria and a linked
  spec/change. Labels route work and never replace the issue body; see
  [`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`](agents/triage-labels.md).
- Commit one logical change with a conventional prefix, reference the
  issue/change, run `npm run hygiene` and `npm run check`, and never add a
  `Co-authored-by` trailer, a generated artifact or a local path.
- Specs are the contract. The OpenSpec CLI version is an implementation detail
  (2.0 migration in progress); do not hardcode CLI flags in issues, specs or
  docs.
- Only the coordinator closes issues; workers never close, archive or publish.

**Label taxonomy (2026-11-13).** Remote labels now match
[`triage-labels.md`](agents/triage-labels.md): one surface `area:*`, one
`priority:*` and one readiness label. `accepted` was added for triaged work
without an approved spec; the old theme labels (`area:parity`,
`area:architecture`, ...) were removed.

**IR review (2026-11-13).** The remaining open issues passed. Optional
refinements before promotion: #8 refresh the line count and name the e2e
specs; #12 keep the locale trigger explicit; #13 narrow to print CSS or one
delivery format; #15 name the fixture and the missing Behave shapes; #17 name
the benchmark path and budget.

## Resolved

- **B-003 Seed-Test 2.0 group sidecar** — resolved for Tolkira on 2026-11-13.
  The 0.3.0 smoke proved that Seed-Test owns the ~10-line sidecar pre-merge and
  needs no Tolkira change. [#6](https://github.com/Silasoa/tolkira/issues/6) is
  closed; evidence is in
  [`docs/research/seed-test-2-integration.md`](research/seed-test-2-integration.md).
- **B-011 Generated-assets build seam** — decision retained; #14 closed. Keep
  the current convention until a second consumer or a stale-output incident.
- **B-013 JUnit suite-level output** — decided: suite-level output stays
  intentionally unattached; `docs/JUNIT-XML.md` documents it and fixtures
  cover both producer shapes. #16 closed.
- **B-015 Node 20 support policy** — decided and implemented: Node 22 is the
  floor (ADR 0002, `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`); CI covers 22, 24 and 26. #18
  closed.
- **B-016 Public repo hygiene** — audit complete; #20 closed. Removed the
  tracked `model.diff`, added Playwright, cache, editor and swap patterns to
  `.gitignore`, added `docs/README.md` and linked it from `README.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `llms.txt`, archived three unreferenced research notes,
  added the issue/backlog/commit workflow and `npm run hygiene` with CI, and
  replaced the `.opencode` copies with `.agents` skills in `e93b677`.
  Comparison images are kept by decision.
- **Backlog tracker #19** — closed; `docs/BACKLOG.md` is the single open-work
  ledger, GitHub issues are the work items.

## Decisions (do not re-open without a trigger)

- **G13 external attachments / split assets.** Deliberate conflict with the
  one-file/offline promise. Product decision tracked in B-008; do not add
  remote URLs or CDN defaults.
- **G16 lazy rendering.** Deliberate no-JS trade-off. Revisit only after a
  measured large-run problem; the static report is much smaller.
- **Themes/charts.** Deliberate non-goal. Branding is title, metadata, logo,
  accent and dark mode.
- **Comparison images.** Keep the referenced `docs/comparison` images (about
  3.3 MB, 54% of tracked bytes). Revisit if the repo exceeds 10 MB, the images
  exceed 5 MB, or a lighter format preserves the comparison.
- **Generated assets.** Keep the current convention until a second consumer or
  a stale-output incident occurs (B-011).
- **Node 20.** Keep Node 22 LTS as the supported floor until a green Node 20
  smoke test exists (B-015).

## Fixed in 0.3

- Outlines/examples, hooks, diagnostics, empty-run semantics, rules/tags,
  Markdown, tag expressions/URL state, CI metadata, attachment polish, CJS
  wrapper, stream adapter, parameter highlighting.
- Architecture: `indexRun` single projection, pure input detection, typed DOM
  contract, CSS filter-status contract.
